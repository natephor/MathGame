# Math Game

A console app I made while attending [C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/).

## Requirements

- [x] You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations.
- [x] The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't
  present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
- [x] Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation.
- [x] You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a
  history of previous games.
- [x] You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

### Extra

- [x] Try to implement levels of difficulty.
- [ ] Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations.
