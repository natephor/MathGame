# Math Game

A console app I made while attending [C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/).

## Requirements

- [x] You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
- [x] The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
- [x] Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
- [x] You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
- [x] You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

### Extra
- [ ] Try to implement levels of difficulty.
- [ ] Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
- [ ] Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations
- [ ] To follow the DRY Principle, try using just one method for all games. Additionally, double-check your project and try to find opportunities to achieve the same functionality with less code, avoiding repetition when possible.
